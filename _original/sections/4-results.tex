% \section{Results}
% \label{sec:result}
% In this section, we analyze and present the results from our data collection, which includes both sensor data and interview data.
% %
% First in \autoref{sec:result-overview-data},
% we provide an overview of the collected data, highlighting key statistics from the helmet-mounted sensors and enter/exit interviews.
% %
% Second in \autoref{sec:result-systemic},
% we analyze systemic patterns of air pollution and drivers' behaviors collected from the sensors.
% %
% Finally in \autoref{sec:result-individual},
% we integrate the sensor-collected data with interview insights to offer a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between air pollution exposure and individual worker behavior.
% %
% % Finally in \autoref{sec:result-communal-engagement}, we describe how our online technical support messaging group has progressively evolved into a community space for the drivers to notify other drivers regarding potential air pollution hazards on a specific day and collectively strategizing their service routes.
