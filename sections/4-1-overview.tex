\section{Overview of Collected Data}
\label{sec:result-overview-data}

\paragraph{Air Quality Data From Sensors}
Over the seven-month period (November 2023 to mid-May 2024), we collected data from ten motorcycle rideshare drivers in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, covering peak and non-peak pollution seasons.
Each driver wore a helmet-mounted low-cost PM2.5 sensor, calibrated against stationary PCD air quality towers in Chiang Mai and Bangkok.
In total, we captured over 50 million data points on street-level pollution in approximately 163.49 km$^2$ driven in Bangkok and 97.21 km$^2$ in downtown Chiang Mai.
Drivers drive approximately 6-10 hours per day, with consistent sensor functionality powered by portable power banks.

\mick{What did we do to clean the data?}


\paragraph{Sensor Data Cleaning}
To ensure accuracy, each sensor was field-tested by co-locating it with a reference air quality station operated by Thailandâ€™s Pollution Control Department (PCD) in Bangkok.
Over five days, three low-cost sensors showed strong alignment with hourly PM2.5 readings from the PCD station, with Pearson correlation coefficients consistently above 0.81, indicating high reliability.





\paragraph{Exit Interviews}
We conducted qualitative exit interviews with all participants to supplement the sensor data. 
These interviews focused on understanding drivers' experiences with sensor-equipped helmets, their daily driving patterns, and any changes in awareness or behavior regarding air pollution. 
The author, a native Thai speaker, conducted the 60-90 minute interviews, using a semi-structured approach with open-ended questions.
