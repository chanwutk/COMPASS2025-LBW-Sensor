\section{Overview of Collected Data}
\label{sec:result-overview-data}

\paragraph{Air Quality Data From Sensors}
Over the seven-month period (November 2023 to mid-May 2024), we collected data from ten motorcycle rideshare drivers in Bangkok and Chiang Mai, covering peak and non-peak pollution seasons.
Each driver wore a helmet-mounted low-cost PM2.5 sensor, calibrated against stationary PCD air quality towers in Chiang Mai and Bangkok.
In total, we captured over 50 million data points on street-level pollution in approximately 163.49 km$^2$ driven in Bangkok and 97.21 km$^2$ in downtown Chiang Mai.
Drivers drive approximately 6-10 hours per day, with consistent sensor functionality powered by portable power banks.

\paragraph{Exit Interviews}
We conducted qualitative exit interviews with all participants to supplement the sensor data. 
These interviews focused on understanding drivers' experiences with sensor-equipped helmets, their daily driving patterns, and any changes in awareness or behavior regarding air pollution. 
The author, a native Thai speaker, conducted the 60-90 minute interviews, using a semi-structured approach with open-ended questions.
